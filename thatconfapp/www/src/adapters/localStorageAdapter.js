He took an early interest in computer programming, figuring out how to get past security to be able to play games on his dad's computer. He's still that feisty nerd, but at least now he gets paid to do it.\r\n\r\nAfter being a full time Java consultant for five years, he moved to a full-time mobile architect position for a year and now is with Automattic (WordPress.com, Akismet, SimpleNote) as a Mobile Maker. Aaron's interest in mobile development has been ever increasing since he got his first iOS app in Apple's App Store in 2009, Migraine Diary. Other than software development, Aaron enjoys camping during the summer, taking his dogs for a walk around the neighborhood, and pretending to be a storm chaser while sitting at home. ",

I’ve got a compass.\r\nMy first job resulted from pointing out the lack of validation of a paper database to a college professor. Since then, I have worked as a 3-D Animator, Project Manager, and Business Analyst.  What I liked about all of these roles were that they let me focus on details of an experience… Details that others often forget. Currently I am the User Experience Designer at Ektron.\r\nI am also very active in the local community; I’m a Co-Organizer of New England GiveCamp and BarCamp Manchester as well as the founder of Float Left Labs.

Mr. Huckaby’s uncanny prediction of locally installed, native application popularity became true.

Mr. Huckaby is consistently rated in the top 10% of all speakers at these events. Having worked for or with Microsoft for over 25 years, Mr. Huckaby has been on stage with, and done numerous keynote demos for many Microsoft executives including Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. \r\n\r\nIn 1999 Mr. Huckaby founded InterKnowlogy, a custom application development firm that creates high-impact software experiences and continues to flourish over 15 years later.  In 2011 Mr. Huckaby founded Actus Interactive Software, which licenses a suite of Interactive Digital Signage products, as a product company compliment to InterKnowlogy.  Mr. Huckaby founded both companies and serves each of them as Chairman.  \r\n\r\nMr. Huckaby has 35 years of technology experience including serving on a Microsoft server product team as a development lead on an architecture team.  Mr. Huckaby worked on some famous and not so famous Microsoft Server codebases in the late nineties.

More recently, he created platforms and organizational models for Cloud computing based on opensource software technologies.  Are these some how related? We think so.",
