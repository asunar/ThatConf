	var showHome = function(){
		replaceChildren(content, "<div><div>This is home</div></div>");
	};


line 2 throws: Uncaught NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': The new child element is null.

Create element:
	var showHome = function(){
		var div = document.createElement("div");
		div.innerHTML = "<h3>This is home</h3>";
		replaceChildren(content, div );
	};

Forgot to remove the + at the beginning of the template text to concat.
It was like this
				var template = 
				+ "<span>" 
				.......
Spent an hour to figure why template was outputting NaN at the beginning.
-------------
script filename was localStorageAdapter.js(note the lowercase l) however the it was referenced
using ...src="LocalStorageAdapter.js". The app worked on my machine and in PhoneGap developer app but failed on the device
used PhoneGap build debug to find out that the error was ReferenceError: Cannot find LocalStorageAdapter. 
Took me several hours to determine that the cause was the inconsistent casing. Fixed reference, everything started working.
------------
If you add new test devices, generate a new mobileprovision file and upload it to PhoneGap build (Doh!)
