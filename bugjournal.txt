	var showHome = function(){
		replaceChildren(content, "<div><div>This is home</div></div>");
	};


line 2 throws: Uncaught NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': The new child element is null.

Create element:
	var showHome = function(){
		var div = document.createElement("div");
		div.innerHTML = "<h3>This is home</h3>";
		replaceChildren(content, div );
	};


Forgot to remove the + at the beginning of the template text to concat.
It was like this
				var template = 
				+ "<span>" 
				.......
Spent an hour to figure why template was outputting NaN at the beginning.
