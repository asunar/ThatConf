What
We will build a cross platform mobile apps for the conf to illustrate concepts like SPA/routing/templating/testing/packaging/app store submission




We will essentially build a web app, package it with PhoneGap so that we can put it in the app store.

The golden rule is PhoneGap apps are web apps.

Ok, so how should we build our app? Use jquerymobile, sencha touch, ionic, angular, backbone, ember react.

Hmm, maybe we should compare each fx and pick the one we like? Tech lock in?

Let's start building the app and pull in libs/fxs if/when we need them.

Routing - Today / Tomorrow / Full Schedule / Speakers / Sessions / My schedule

Theme: State your problem, super reader? Find a solution with minimal dependencies and max maintainability.

hashChange event
replace children

adapters / localStorage / offline

views / templating / caching compiled templates

ui css :active / hardware acceleration / fastclick

PhoneGap build, configap.

Promise lib to get updates? Updated schedule for ex.
